### Hey, itâ€™s Edgar!  ðŸ‘‹

One day an algorithm found me and taught me how to learn to code. That's how it all started for me.

Software development has allowed me to learn and create something new every day. I've had failures and achievements that have given me lessons that I apply daily. 

I love being involved in creating products that are useful to people and solving problems regardless of tech stack. Thatâ€™s why I love working/learning across backend, API, desktop, mobile, and web.

Right now, I'm a Front-end Developer. Worked on 10+ web and mobile projects alongside designers, developers, and managers, raising my standards to deliver the highest quality products.
